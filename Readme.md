# Data Structures and ALgorithms

This README provides a brief overview of different Data Structures and ALgorithms.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Key concepts include:
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods into a single unit.
- **Inheritance:** Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
- **Polymorphism:** Objects of different types can be treated as objects of a common base type.
- **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems by modeling essential features.

## Procedural Programming

Procedural Programming organizes code as a series of procedures or functions. Key characteristics include:
- Sequences of instructions executed one after another.
- Data is often shared among procedures.
- Emphasis on procedures that operate on data.

## Functional Programming

Functional Programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Key principles include:
- Immutability: Once data is created, it cannot be changed.
- First-class functions: Functions can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments.
- Higher-order functions: Functions that take other functions as parameters.

## Static vs. Dynamic Languages

### Static Languages

Static languages perform type checking at compile-time, and the association between variable names and types is set during compilation. Examples include C, C++, and Java.

### Dynamic Languages

Dynamic languages perform type checking at runtime, and the association between variable names and types is set during program execution. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

## Compile Time vs. Runtime

### Compile Time

Compile time refers to the phase when the source code is translated into machine code or an intermediate code by a compiler. Activities include type checking and syntax checking. Compile-time errors are detected before execution.

### Runtime

Runtime is the phase when the compiled program is running and performing tasks. Activities include executing instructions and processing data. Runtime errors may occur during program execution.
